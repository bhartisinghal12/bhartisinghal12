## 👋 Hi, I’m Bharti Singhal

🎓 I’m a dedicated business analytics and finance student passionate about turning data into actionable insights.

💼 During my internship at **Birlasoft**, I worked hands-on with tools like **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to:
- Extract and transform data
- Build interactive dashboards
- Support strategic decision-making through analytics

📊 My academic background in **finance** & **business analytics** helps me understand the “why” behind the numbers, while my analytics training reveals the “how.” This blend allows me to approach financial challenges from both **strategic and analytical** perspectives.

🔍 I’m always exploring new ways to use data to solve real-world problems and create value through **data-driven innovation**.
