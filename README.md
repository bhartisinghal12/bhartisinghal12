👋 Hi, I’m bhartisinghal
I’m a dedicated student with a strong passion for business analytics and finance. During my internship at Birlasoft, I gained hands-on experience in leveraging tools 
like SQL, Excel, and Power BI to extract actionable insights, build dashboards, and support strategic decision-making processes.My academic background in finance 
gives me a solid foundation to understand the “why” behind the numbers, while my data analytics skills help me uncover the “how.” This unique blend allows me
to approach financial challenges from both analytical and strategic perspectives.

I’m continuously exploring new ways to use data to solve real-world problems and contribute to meaningful, data-driven innovations.

📌 Interests: Business Intelligence, Financial Modeling, Data Visualization, Decision Science
🛠 Tools: SQL | Power BI | Excel | Python (Basics)
🚀 Always eager to collaborate on finance + analytics projects!
